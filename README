Need to use a CNAME at the root of your website at CloudFlare?
Is that causing email deliverability issues?

This should help.

This resolves the CNAME record to the associated A record(s), makes and API call to CloudFlare, and creates the necessary A record(s). This way you can have an A record at the root -- which should fix the email deliverability issues.

--------------------

1.) Fill out the values at the top of the script.
2.) Run the script the initial time and verify you now have A records in place of where the CNAME previously was. Confirm it's working correctly.
3.) Schedule a cron job to run this script as often as you feel comfortable with. The suggestion being every minute.
